        <h4>A Story of Love and Hurt.</h4>

        <div class="w3-justify">
            <p>

                My beloved daughter, Brisa, left this world too soon,
                driven to despair by the insidious grip of
                depression. Her story is one of tragedy, but it's also the driving force behind our mission.
                As an extraordinary individual, Brisa excelled in both mathematics and art. She ranked
                second in her high school, earned a scholarship to Ohio State University, and studied
                computer science engineering. Yet, her true passion lay in art, where she poured her heart
                and soul into expressing her mental battles and her unique perspective on the world. Her
                journey with depression led to episodes so severe that hospitalization became necessary.
                Despite the hardships, her future seemed bright.
